## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- Started to think more about grid design which is super powerful. My first line of thought is to use flexbox but I jpo that changes in the future to a more balanced approach.
- The box-shadow was a challenge but I liked it. I can do a lot of stuff with it.

### Continued development

- Get better with grids
